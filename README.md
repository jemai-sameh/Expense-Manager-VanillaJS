# Gestion-des-d-penses-avec-Vanilla-JS

This TP consists of the development of an expense management application.
An expense is defined by a title and a sum (a real one).
A new expense is represented inthe interface by a Card, as shown in the figures, with two buttons Delete and Add.
Each added expense is recorded in a list of expenses and the total sumsinserted is calculated as expenses are added.
This application must be developed with Vanilla Javascript (without any framework).
