# Gestion-des-d-penses-avec-Vanilla-JS

This project involves the development of an expense management application. An expense is defined by a title and a sum (a real number). A new expense is represented in the interface interface by a Card, as shown in the figures, with two buttons, Delete and Add.
Each added expense is recorded in an expense list, and the total of the amounts is calculated as each expense is added. 
This application is to be developed using Vanilla Javascript (without any framework).
